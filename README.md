# oilgas_pipeline_statistical-data
## GIS data about gas company's pipeline is statistic result  

Why I summary these pipeline data about thickness and diameter and material attributes? 

Beacause we will use pipeline simulator software to simulate gas flow in real situation. 

We should recorrect pipeline physical attribute after we have classed these pipeline information
